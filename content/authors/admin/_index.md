I am a PhD Candidate in Economics and Social Sciences at Vienna University of Economics and Business. I study the extent, causes and consequences of inequalities. My research aims at fostering our understanding of how social, economic and political institutions and mechanisms link inequalities in opportunities to inequalities in outcomes. I also want to strengthen our toolbox for measuring inequalities, for instance in terms of income, wealth and between regions. My work has been polished in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A, Cambridge Journal of Economy Regions and Society and Ecological Economics. My main teaching interests are in labour economics, econometrics and economic geogrpahy.      

On this page, you find information about my publications, working papers and ongoing research projecets, public writing and upcoming conferences. You can download my CV here. 

I work as an economist at the Austrian Federal Chamber of Labour in Vienna where I serve as Editor of Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft while finishing my PhD at the Institute for Economic Geography at WU Vienna. I am also teaching Economics of Distribution, Spatial Economics and Empirical Social Research at WU Vienna, where I am affiliated as a guest researcher at the Research Institute Economics of Inequality (INEQ). 

My work has been funded, amongst others, by the Austrian Economic Association, the Vienna Science and Technology Fund, WU Vienna and I have received several competitive awards, for instance the Nancy and Richard Ruggles Memorial Award of the International Association for Research on Income and Wealth. 

I will be visiting resacher at UC Berkeley under the Austria-Berkely Exchange Programme in the second half 2021, and LISER 2022, before defending my PhD dissertation.
