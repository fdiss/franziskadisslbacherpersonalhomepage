Thank you for visiting my homepage! I am a PhD Candidate in Economics and Social Sciences at Vienna University of Economics and Business and I expect to graduate in March 2022. I am an economist at Department of Economics and Statistics at the Vienna Chamber of Labour.  My research interest lies at the intersections of labor economics, public economics and economic geography and I study the extent, causes and consequences of inequalities. My research aims at fostering our understanding of how social, economic and political institutions and mechanisms link inequality in opportunities to inequalities in outcomes. I also want to strengthen our toolbox for  measuring of inequality, for instance in terms of income, wealth or between regions.  My teaching interest are econometrics, labor economics, and spatial economics. 

On this page, you find information on my publications and ongoing reserach projects, teaching and comments published in the media and media.
