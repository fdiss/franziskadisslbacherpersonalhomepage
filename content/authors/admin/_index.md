THIS PAGE IS WORK IN PROGRESS; CURRENTLY BEING TESTED! IT MAY CONTAIN INFORMATION THAT IS INCOMPLETE - OR - NOT CORRECT! THE FINAL PAGE WILL BE BUBLISHED WITHIN A COUPLE OF HOURS! TAHNK YOU  Thank you for visiting my homepage! I am a PhD Candidate in Econmics at Vienna University of Economics and Business within an expected degree date of 03/2022. I work as an economist at the Vienna Chamber of Labour. I study the extent, causes and consequences of inqualities. I work on the measurement and distribution of income and wealth, with a special emphasis on inter/intragenerational aspects and spatial inequalitites. Also, I wanto to find out how social, political and economic institutions and mechanisms link inequalitites in opportunitites to inequalities in outcomes. 

My work has been published, for instance, in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A: Statistics in Society, Ecological Ecoomics and the Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society. I won several reserach grants for my PhD research and was awarded international and national research prizes!
