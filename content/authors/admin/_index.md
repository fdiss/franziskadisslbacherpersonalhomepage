I am a PhD Candidate in Economics and Social Sciences at Vienna University of Economics and Business. I study the extent, causes and consequences of inequalities. My research aims at fostering our understanding of how social, economic and political institutions and mechanisms link inequalities in opportunities to inequalities in outcomes. I also want to strengthen our toolbox for measuring inequalities, for instance in terms of income, wealth and over space. 

My work has been published in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A: Statistics in Society, Cambridge Journal of Economy Regions and Society and Ecological Economics. 

As my work has a strong policy focus, I currently work as an economist at the Austrian Federal Chamber of Labour in Vienna and I regularly contribute to media, print as well as online. And I actively disseminate my research outcomes to broad and diverse audiences by writing for blogs. 
I teach Economics of Distribution, Economic Policy, Spatial Economics and recently also Econometrics at WU Vienna where I am affiliated with the Research Institute Economics of Inequality (INEQ). 

I will finish my PhD in June 2022. I will be based as visiting researcher at the Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley between August and December 2022, and at the Department Living Conditions at LISER from January to April 2022.
