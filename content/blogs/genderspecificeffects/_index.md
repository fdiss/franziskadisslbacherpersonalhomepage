We surveyed Austrians during the first lockdowns on the multiple burdens resulting from the stay-at-home-order, the shift towards work-from-home (for some parts of the population) and the closure of childcare facilitites, schools, cultural facilitites and they like. The lockdown shifted parts of production from market to non-market production. While market production (for instance, schooling, a paid babysitter, or the consumption of a meal at a restaurent) is counted in productivity and income measures and statistics, unpaid work is *uncounted and invisiable* although it keeps the economy going. We asked how households divided the increased volumen of unpaid work, if it impacted their mental health condition, and how they coped with this new situation, for instance, in terms of the combination of home schooling and working-from-home. 

We published a series of blogs that summarize our main results and conclusions. These contributions can read [here](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/vw3/research/current-projects/genderspecificeffectsofcovid-19); for a german version click [here](https://www.wu.ac.at/vw3/forschung/laufende-projekte/genderspezifscheeffektevoncovid-19).
