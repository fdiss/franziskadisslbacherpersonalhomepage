During the first lockdown in Austria, we surveyed Austrians on the multiple burdens resulting from the stay-at-home-order, the shift towards work-from-home (for some parts of the population) and the closure of childcare facilitites, schools, cultural facilitites and they like. The lockdown shifted parts of production from market to non-market production. While market production (for instance, schooling, a paid babysitter, or the consumption of a meal at a restaurent) is counted in productivity and income measures, unpaid work is uncounted and invisiable although it keeps the economy going. We asked how households dividie this unpaid work, if it impacts their mental health, and how they coped with this new situation, for instance, in terms of the combination of home schooling and working-from-home. 

We published a series of blogs that summarize our main results and conclusions.
