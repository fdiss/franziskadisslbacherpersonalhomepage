**Abstract**

Poor coverage of the top in wealth surveys conceals the extent of wealth inequality. The literature mitigates this shortcoming by enriching survey data with rich lists and estimating the top tail with a Pareto distribution. However, recent studies rely on ad-hoc assumptions for some of the required parameters. We suggest a unified regression ap- proach to estimate all parameters of a Pareto distribution jointly and extend our analysis with a more flexible three-parameter Generalized Pareto estimation. We introduce a new database of national rich lists (ERLDB) as an alternative to commonly used global rich lists to combine with survey data from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS 2017). Our findings for 14 European countries show that wealth is more concen- trated than surveys suggest, with almost doubling Top 1% shares in the most extreme cases. In contrast, countries with successful oversampling strategies tend to experience only minor changes in inequality metrics.

### Home, sweet home? The impact of working from home on the division of unpaid work during COVID-19 lockdown

In: INEQ Working Paper #21 / WU Vienna; With J. Derndorfer, V. Lechinger, E. Six and K. Mader

{{< figure src="wp21fig.jpg" caption="Who cares when working from home?">}}


**Abstract**
A lockdown implies a shift from the public to the private sphere, and from market to non-market production, thereby increasing the volume of unpaid work.  Already before the pandemic, unpaid work was disproportionately borne by women. This paper studies the effect of working from home for pay (WFH), due to a lockdown, on the change in the division of household work and childcare within couple households. While previous studies on the effect of WFH on the reconciliation of work and family life and the division of labour within household suffered from selection bias, we are able to identify this effect building upon the shock of the first COVID-19 lockdown in Austria. The corresponding legal measures left little choice over WFH. In any case, WFH is exogenous conditional on a small set of individual and household characteristics we control for.  We employ data from a survey on the gendered aspects of the lockdown. The dataset includes detailed information on time use during the lockdown and on the quality and experience of WFH. Uniquely, this survey data also includes information on the division, and not only magnitude, of unpaid work within households. Austria is an interesting case in this respect as it is characterized by very conservative gender norms. The results reveal that the probability of men taking on a larger share of household work increases if men are WFH alone or together with their female partner. By contrast, the involvement of men in childcare increased only in case the female partner was not able to WFH. Overall, the burden of childcare, and particularly home-schooling, was disproportionately borne by women.

### Recovering Regional Income Distributions using Generalized Pareto Estimation: An application to Income Inequality in the United States; with M. Moser

**Abstract** 

This paper uses recently introduced Generalized Pareto Estimation methods to recover full income distributions for the United States American Community Survey data on the state, county, and tract levels. Our approach adds to the literature on regional income inequality by extrapolating quantiles from the recorded grouped income data while at the same time correcting for potential under-coverage of rich households. Using this new data set on regional income inequality we provide examples of two-stage nested and dynamic Theil decompositions to illustrate how these data can improve our understanding of local inequality dynamics in the U.S. We find that 80% of national level income inequality are due to income inequality within tracts and over time, within-tract income inequality drives national level inequality. However, this is due to specific tracts located in population-rich, urbanized areas and regions closely connected to global financialization, and digitization. A counterfactual decomposition reveals that 1.5 % of the tracts drive national level income inequality up, while an equal number of tracts pushes national level income inequality in the opposite direction. Replacing the growth/reduction in inequality in these equalizing and dis-equalizing tracts with the national average would leave us with virtually no change in aggregate income inequality over the period 2010-2018.

### The Geography of Intergnerational Mobiliy in Austria. Evidence from Large Register Data

The pronounced spatial variation in intergenerational mobility within countries has catched attention during the last years. While Austria is a country with a comparably low degree of inequality in incomes, due to redistribution via taxes, benefits and the provision of social infrastructures, little is known about intergenerational mobility. However, while several studies stress that intergenerational persistance of education is as high as in high income inequality countrieos there is no evidence on intergenerational persistance in income and its spatial variation. In this paper, I provide evidence on absolute and relative intergenerational mobility in terms of education and income and its variation across communitites. I employ data from social insurance records, tax statistics and the register based census spanning the period 1974-2018. I expected that intergenerational mobilitiy in income is much higher than intergenerational mobiltiy in income for two reasons. First, the unique system of dual education decreases upward mobilty inducation, this is n



### Income inequality within and between regions in the United States: An integrated approach; with M. Moser

**Abstract**

This paper proposes a novel approach for the joint study of within- and between-region income inequality that is consistently applicable to nested regions at various spatial scales and is based on full income distributions instead of summary indicators of income inequality. This framework is applied to household income inequality in the Census Tracts nested in the 323 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) of the United States in a cross-sectional setting. Starting with tabulated income data from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018, we estimate full income distribution in the form of 100 percentiles for each tract employing recently developed Generalized Pareto Distribution methods. Thereby, we account for underreporting of incomes at the top and allow for a varying degree of income inequality along the distribution. Given the full distribution of income by tract, we propose that a comparison of percentiles of the tracts nested in a MSAs provides a measure for between-region inequality, while the full set of percentiles for each tract measures within-region inequality. In addition, we are able to identify spatial variations in the segregation of affluence and poverty. To give a stylized example, in case the bottom 90 percentiles of a tract align with the corresponding MSA level percentiles, and the top 10 percentiles are above the corresponding MSA level percentiles, a tract is characterized by segregation of the affluent. By working with full income distributions, we are able to highlight region-specific characteristics of the income distribution that are masked by summary indicators such as the Gini-coefficient or the Theil-index Finally, the approach is applicable to individual as well as tabulated income data and generalizable to any hierarchically nested regions. Overall, we contribute the literatures on intra- and inter-regional income inequality and income segregation by building a bridge between them.
